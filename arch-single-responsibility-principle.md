Single Responsibility Principe(SRP) is one of [[arch-solid|SOLID]] principles.

Uncle Bob determined it as:
> Gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons

Where by reason he means people that use the application. In other words, group of users such as admins, customers, etc.

This principle and “_coupling & cohesion”_ from GRASP are closely intertwined.
