Pure fabrication refers to entities that do not exist in the business domain but are abstractions within the program. These abstractions can be system-level constructs that are easy to reuse. Such abstractions help reduce the amount of system-specific code within the business domain.

Promise, Socket, Connection, Proxy, Request, Response, Server, Stream, Queue, Transaction, etc
