# Welcome to my Zettelkasten Knowledge Base ðŸŒŸ
This repo contains a knowledge base in zettelkasten format. I prefer to use Obsidian as my tool for zettelkasten because it is a powerful and flexible note-taking app that is well-suited for the zettelkasten method. Obsidian allows me to easily create, link, and navigate my notes, and it also offers a variety of features that make it easy to learn and use.

The zettelkasten method is a powerful way to organize and manage your knowledge. It is based on the idea of creating a network of interconnected notes, which can be easily linked together. This makes it easy to find information and to see how different ideas relate to each other.

The zettelkasten method has many benefits, including:
- It can help you to learn more effectively.
- It can help you to be more creative.
- It can help you to be more organized.

## Personal Experience

Before using zettelkasten, I used to create notes by topic. However, as my knowledge base grew, these notes became "fat" and full of details. Additionally, some topics were related to other topics, which led to duplication of thoughts.
The zettelkasten method has helped me to overcome these challenges by encouraging me to create atomic notes that focus on a single idea or thought. These notes are then linked together to create a network of knowledge that is easy to navigate and explore.

# Topics
In my system, I name my notes with a topic prefix, and then add tags to each note. The tags can be specific to the topic of the note, such as #docker, or they can be more general, such as #issue. I find this system to be helpful for quickly finding the information I need.

## General tags
| Tag      | Description                                                                                                   |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| #issue   | A note that explains how to resolve or avoid a particular issue, or reveals the circumstances when it occurs. |
| #source  | Books, YouTube videos, articles, and courses from which I gained this knowledge.                              |
